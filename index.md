Postgres/MySQL/MariaDB/SQLite3 adapter for [js-data](http://www.js-data.io/).

### API Documentation
[DSSqlAdapter](http://www.js-data.io/docs/dssqladapter)

### Quick Start
`npm install --save knex js-data js-data-sql`.

You also need to install the driver for the database you want to connect to.

`npm install --save <mysql|mariasql|pg|sqlite3>`

```js
var JSData = require('js-data');
var DSSqlAdapter = require('js-data-sql');

var store = new JSData.DS();
var adapter = new DSSqlAdapter({
  client: 'mysql', // or "pg" or "sqlite3"
  connection: {
    host: '123.45.67.890',
    user: 'ubuntu',
    password: 'welcome1234'
  }
});

store.registerAdapter('sql', adapter, { default: true });

// "store" will now use the Sql adapter for all async operations
```

#### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Contribute to the issue/discussion that is the reason you'll be developing in
the first place
1. Fork js-data-sql
1. `git clone git@github.com:<you>/js-data-sql.git`
1. `cd js-data-sql; npm install;`
1. Write your code, including relevant documentation and tests
1. Run `npm test` (build and test)
  - You need io.js or Node 4.x that includes generator support without a flag
1. Your code will be linted and checked for formatting, the tests will be run
1. The `dist/` folder & files will be generated, do NOT commit `dist/*`! They
will be committed when a release is cut.
1. Submit your PR and we'll review!
1. Thanks!

#### Have write access?

Here's how to make a release on the `master` branch:

1. Bump `package.json` to the appropriate version.
1. `npm test` must succeed.
1. This time, the built `dist/js-data-sql.js` file _will_ be committed, so stage its changes.
1. Mention the release version in the commit message, e.g. `Stable Version 1.2.3`
1. Push to master.
1. Create a git tag. Name it the version of the release, e.g. `1.2.3`
  - Easiest way is to just create a GitHub Release, which will create the tag for you. Name the Release and the git tag the same thing.
1. `git fetch origin` if you tagged it via GitHub Release, so you can get the tag on your local machine.
1. `npm publish .` (Make sure you got the version bumped correctly!)
